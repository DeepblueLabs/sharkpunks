# SharkPunks Collection: multi-chain NFTs on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon

SharkPunks, a unique and innovative project that brings together the power of sharks, nature, and finance through the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. With a total of 5000 unique pieces, the SharkPunks NFT collection offers proof of ownership for each individual token, ensuring that each one is truly one of a kind.

In addition to its value as a collectible, the SharkPunks NFT collection also has real-world utility, providing access to a range of exciting projects and developments that benefit from the support of the SharkPunks community. Through the use of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), the community has the ability to autonomously choose the projects that are eligible for investment rounds, ensuring that the investment opportunities offered by the collection are aligned with the interests and goals of the community.
